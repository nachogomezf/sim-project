# Introduction

-   Goal:
    -   Compute the probability that the capital of an insurance company remains positive during a given time period
-   Data:
    -   Premium: $a$
    -   Claims rate: $Poisson (\lambda)$
    -   Premium amount: $Pareto (2.5, 100)$
    -   Enrollment rate: $Poisson(\nu)$
    -   Departure rate: $Exp(\mu)$
    -   Initial capital: $c_0$

# Introduction

So in general, the capital of the company at any time $t$ will be:

$$C(t) = c_0 + at(n_0+N_A(t)-N_D(t)) - \sum_{j=1}^{N_C(t)} X_j$$

where:

```{=tex}
\begin{itemize}
\item $N_A(t)$ is the number of clients that arrive by time $t$
\item $N_D(t)$ is the number of clients that leave by time $t$
\item $N_C(t)$ is the number of claims that arrive by time $t$
\item $X_j$ is the amount of the $j$-th claim
\item $n(t)$ is the number of clients at time $t$.
\end{itemize}
```
# The project

![alt text](flux.png "Title")

# Results

Both the discrete event simulation algorithm we developed and the one using antithetic variables gave the same results, meaning that the variance was not reduced from the original algorithm. These were the results:

```{=tex}
\begin{itemize}
\item Fraction of paths (simulations) that remained positive throughout their respective lengths: 0.9984
\item Mean of the final capital for those positive paths: 91573.45
\item Standard deviation of the final capital for those positive paths: 9182.815
\end{itemize}
```
These were the results for $c_0 = 1000$, $n_0 = 100$, $a = 100$, $tl = 100$, $\lambda = 0.1$, $\mu = 0.1$, $\nu = 0.1$ and $MC = 10000$:

# Conclusions

About the results, how the difficulties were solved, and possible alternative approaches. Keep the focus, the conclusions must be as brief as possible.
