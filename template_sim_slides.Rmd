# Introduction

-   Goal:
    -   Compute the probability that the capital of an insurance company remains positive during a given time period
-   Data:
    -   Premium: $a$
    -   Claims rate: $Poisson (\lambda)$
    -   Premium amount: $Pareto (2.5, 100)$
    -   Enrollment rate: $Poisson(\nu)$
    -   Departure rate: $Exp(\mu)$
    -   Initial capital: $c_0$

# Introduction

So in general, the capital of the company at any time $t$ will be:

$$C(t) = c_0 + at(n_0+N_A(t)-N_D(t)) - \sum_{j=1}^{N_C(t)} X_j$$

where:

```{=tex}
\begin{itemize}
\item $N_A(t)$ is the number of clients that arrive by time $t$
\item $N_D(t)$ is the number of clients that leave by time $t$
\item $N_C(t)$ is the number of claims that arrive by time $t$
\item $X_j$ is the amount of the $j$-th claim
\item $n(t)$ is the number of clients at time $t$.
\end{itemize}
```
# The project
```{r, out.width='70%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(c("flux.png"))
```

# Results

We used 2 different approaches for this problem

```{=tex}
\begin{itemize}
\item A discrete event simulation algorithm we developed
\item An improved version of our algorithm using antithetic variables to reduce the variance
\end{itemize}
```
These were the results for $c_0 = 1000$, $n_0 = 100$, $a = 100$, $tl = 100$, $\lambda = 0.1$, $\mu = 0.1$, $\nu = 0.1$ and $MC = 10000$:

```{r, out.width='80%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(c("results_table_comparison.png"))
```

# Results

**1** Simulating with $c_0 = 1000$, $n_0 = 100$, $a = 100$, $t_l = 100$, $\lambda = 0.1$, $\mu = 0.1$, $\nu = 0.3$ and $M_C = 10000$.
```{r, fig.show="hold", out.width="45%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images-pres/mean_sim_1.png", "images-pres/densities_sim_1.png"))
```
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>'

# Results
**2** Simulating with $c_0 = 100$, $n_0 = 10000$, $a = 20$, $t_l = 50$, $\lambda = 0.05$, $\mu = 0.2$, $\nu = 0.6$ and $M_C = 1000$.
```{r, fig.show="hold", out.width="45%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images-pres/mean_sim_2.png","images-pres/densities_sim_2.png"))
```
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

# Results
**3** Simulating with $c_0 = 10000$, $n_0 = 5$, $a = 2000$, $t_l = 25$, $\lambda = 0.5$, $\mu = 0.1$, $\nu = 0.8$ and $M_C = 10000$.
```{r, fig.show="hold", out.width="45%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images-pres/mean_sim_3.png", "images-pres/densities_sim_3.png"))
```
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

# Results

These graphs show both the convergence of the mean of the final capitals in terms of the number of simulations and the density of the final capitals. Note that the color red indicates the antithetic variables approach

```{r, fig.show="hold", out.width="45%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(c("mean_final_cap.png", "densities_final_caps.png"))
```

# Conclusions

```{=tex}
\begin{itemize}
\item The antithetic approach does not significantly reduce the variance but it does improve the computing time, cutting it in half
\item We also encountered some difficulties while developing the simulations
\begin{itemize}
\item Updating the proportional part of payments after simulating the type of event
\item Trying to obtain the total number of events beforehand
\item Antithetic variable approach showing the same results as our own approach
\end{itemize}
\item The project was a fine representation of how simulations can be used in the insurance policies business
\end{itemize}
```
