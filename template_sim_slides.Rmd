# Introduction

-   Goal:
    -   Compute the probability that the capital of an insurance company remains positive during a given time period
-   Data:
    -   Premium: $a$
    -   Claims rate: $Poisson (\lambda)$
    -   Premium amount: $Pareto (2.5, 100)$
    -   Enrollment rate: $Poisson(\nu)$
    -   Departure rate: $Exp(\mu)$
    -   Initial capital: $c_0$

# Introduction

So in general, the capital of the company at any time $t$ will be:

$$C(t) = c_0 + at(n_0+N_A(t)-N_D(t)) - \sum_{j=1}^{N_C(t)} X_j$$

where:

```{=tex}
\begin{itemize}
\item $N_A(t)$ is the number of clients that arrive by time $t$
\item $N_D(t)$ is the number of clients that leave by time $t$
\item $N_C(t)$ is the number of claims that arrive by time $t$
\item $X_j$ is the amount of the $j$-th claim
\item $n(t)$ is the number of clients at time $t$.
\end{itemize}
```
# The project

![alt text](flux.png "Title")

# Results

We used 2 different approaches for this problem

```{=tex}
\begin{itemize}
\item A discrete event simulation algorithm we developed
\item An improved version of our algorithm using antithetic variables to reduce the variance
\end{itemize}
```
These were the results for $c_0 = 1000$, $n_0 = 100$, $a = 100$, $tl = 100$, $\lambda = 0.1$, $\mu = 0.1$, $\nu = 0.1$ and $MC = 10000$:

```{r, out.width='80%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(c("results_table_comparison.png"))
```

# Results

These graphs show both the convergence of the mean of the final capitals in terms of the number of simulations and the density of the final capitals. Note that the color red indicates the antithetic variables approach

```{r, out.width='80%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(c("mean_final_cap.png", "densities_final_caps.png"))
```

# Conclusions

About the results, how the difficulties were solved, and possible alternative approaches. Keep the focus, the conclusions must be as brief as possible.
